Hazel Engine

In this repository I am following a series on game engine development on YouTube. This repository is to give myself the opportunity to process and understand
the components of a game engine while also coding in C++. The intention is to have a properly documented engine which does not happen during the YouTube
videos and also develop basic games with good software development pratices such as unit test and design documents.
